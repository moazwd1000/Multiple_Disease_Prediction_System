# Multiple Disease Prediction System

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease based on user inputs. The system uses trained models saved in 'saved_models' files to provide real-time predictions.

The application is built with Python and uses the **Streamlit** library to create an interactive user interface.

## Features
- **Diabetes Prediction**: Predicts the presence of diabetes from health parameters.
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Estimates the risk of heart disease.
- **Parkinson’s Disease Prediction**: Detects signs of Parkinson’s disease.

## Technologies Used
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- Streamlit (for the web interface)
- Pickle (for loading saved ML models)
